## 几何画板

URL for tool translated in Chinese: https://www.jihehuaban.com.cn/

In English, this tool is called "sketchpad" developed by __keycurriculum__, URL is <https://sketchpad.keycurriculum.com/>

It only has Windows and Mac edition

Here are some Linux alternatives of sketchpad:

- GeoGebra: https://alternativeto.net/software/geogebra/
- GnuPlot: https://alternativeto.net/software/gnuplot/
- Lybniz: https://alternativeto.net/software/lybniz/
- KSEG: https://alternativeto.net/software/kseg/

Have installed GeoGebra in Ubuntu and it's working nice.
